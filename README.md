# audio-player
a simple html5 based audio player with some extra features like custom skin, total duration &amp; how much completed, increase/decrease volume, custom seek bar etc.
Most of the code is in Jquery and any developer can easily understand what's happening in the code. Right now I have embed CSS rules directly into any page but you can create external file if you want.
